abstract="Artificial Intelligence techniques have been successfully applied to several computer games. However in some kinds of computer games, like real-time strategy (RTS) games, traditional artificial intelligence techniques fail to play at a human level because of the vast search spaces that they entail. In this paper we present a real-time case based planning and execution approach designed to deal with RTS games. We propose to extract behavioral knowledge from expert demonstrations in form of individual cases. This knowledge can be reused via a case based behavior generator that proposes behaviors to achieve the specific open goals in the current plan. Specifically, we applied our technique to the WARGUS domain with promising results.",

GR is the study of agents that can deliberate on and self-select their goals/objectives, which is a desirable capability for some applications of deliberative autonomy. While studied in diverse AI sub-communities for multiple applications, our group has focused on how GR can play a key role for controlling autonomous systems. Thus, its importance is rapidly growing and it merits increased attention, particularly from the perspective of research on AI safety. In this article, I introduce GR, briefly relate it to other AI topics, summarize some of our group’s work on GR foundations and emerging applications, and describe some current and future research directions.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={2}, journal={AI Magazine}, author={Aha, David W.}, year={2018}, month={Jul.}, pages={3-24} }

With planning.domains, we aim to (a) collect these resources in a central location; and (b) enable creative possibilities through a consistent interface to the larger planning community. In this demo, we focus on the three main pillars of planning.domains: (1) api.planning.domains – a programmatic interface to all existing planning problems; (2) solver.planning.domains – an open (and extendable) interface to planning-in-the-cloud; and (3) editor.planning.domains - a fully featured editor for planning domains.}
